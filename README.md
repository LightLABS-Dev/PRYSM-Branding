### Logo Usage

1. **Clear Space:** Ensure a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the PRYSM “P” to avoid crowding.
3. **Color Variations:** Use the designated color or monochromatic versions; avoid applying any other colors or filters.

## Usage Guidelines

These guidelines ensure brand consistency across all platforms:

1. **Do not modify the logo** in any way (e.g., no stretching, recoloring outside the approved palette, or adding filters).
2. **Avoid rotating, skewing, or altering** the proportions of the logo.
3. **Limit additional elements** around the logo unless part of approved co-branding.
4. **Secure clear visibility** by avoiding placing the logo over images or backgrounds that compromise its legibility.
